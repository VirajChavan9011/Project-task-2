Project Task: 

What is snowpipe:Snowpipe provides a “pipeline” for loading fresh data in micro-batches as soon as it is available.


Features of snowpipe
1. Snowpipe enables loading data from files as soon as they're available in a stage.
2. This means you can load data from files in micro-batches, making it available to users within minutes,
   rather than manually executing COPY statements on a schedule to load larger batch
3. Snowpipe is Snowflake's continuous data ingestion service.
4. Snowpipe loads data within minutes after files are added to a stage and submitted for ingestion.

Snowsql - it is a command line interpreterit is used to copy the file into your local system to snowflake stage
